However, what if two different properties from different rules target the same elements, they will merge into one and the element will get both properties.

Letâ€™s take a quick look at this example:
P {
color: blue;
}


<style>
p {
font-size: 12px;
}
</style>

The p element will be a blue-colored text with font size 12px which means that the two properties will be applied to the p element.
And this rule is called:  merge rule.
